0.x - Initial releases
---

These initial releases have usable behavior, but may have some rough edges for some users and use cases.

### 0.2.5

#### External changes

### 0.2.4

### 0.2.1

#### External changes

- If status is 404 when getting initial profile information, exit with invalid GitHub username message.
- @hugovk was right, `created_at` is a better check than `status`. `status` not present for valid users. (#11)

- Use gh's default remote, rather than parsing output of `git remote -v` and taking first result. (#13)
