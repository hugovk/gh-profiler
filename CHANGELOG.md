0.x - Initial releases
---

These initial releases have usable behavior, but may have some rough edges for some users and use cases.

### Unreleased

#### External changes

- Start documenting talks and discussions of this project in README.

#### Internal changes

- Run tests in CI via tox.

### 0.6.0

#### External changes

- gh-profiler runs meaningfully faster, by parallelizing the calls that fetch external data.

#### Internal changes

- Basic e2e tests for full and --concise runs. E2e tests are flaky because they make actual gh API calls. E2e tests must be run explicitly, ie `uv run pytest tests/e2e_tests -k full`.
- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` to parallelize the fetching calls. We shouldn't add many more calls, but this should mean a few more quick calls are essentially free. The call to fetch issue activity is the slowest, so any fetch significantly faster than that should add not add to execution time in any meaningful way.
- Supports `--benchmark-fetch`, which lets us easily benchmark just the fetching block.

### 0.5.1

#### External changes

- Commas in account ages over 999 days.
- PR search is restricted to public activity.
- Thresholds upped for problematic behavior related to opening multiple identical issues. For example opening an issue on the wrong repo, closing it, and opening an identical issue on the correct repo should not raise any flags. Old thresholds: 0 green, 1-3 yellow, 4+ red. New: 0-3 green, 4-5 yellow, 6+ red.
- Shows all social media accounts present in user's GH profile.
- Works for Python 3.10. (Was failing on a timestamp-parsing library.)

#### Internal changes

- Manually parse account created_at timestamp. `datetime.fromisoformat()` doesn't work as generally in Python <3.11.

### 0.5.0

#### External changes

- Supports `--generate-workflow`. This writes a `.github/workflows/profile_contributors.yml` file that runs `gh-profiler --concise` any time a new PR or issue is opened on the user's repository. The output is written as a comment on the new PR or issue.

#### Internal changes

- Whenever someone opens a new PR or issue on this repository, the workflow profile_contributors.yml automatically runs gh-profiler against the author. The output is written as a comment on the PR or issue.
- Target is optional in CLI, but validation requires it if not running `--generate-workflow`.

### 0.4.0

#### External changes

- Supports `--concise` flag, which generates a more condensed summary that only shows one line for each major section: profile, recent PR activity, and recent issue activity.

#### Internal changes
---

- Simplified CLI argument parsing.

### 0.3.5

#### External changes

- If target is a PR or issue number, shows the number and title in summary.

#### Internal changes

- cli util sets `pdata.username` directly.
- `ProfileData` uses slots to lock down fields (not values). This ensures that `ProfileData` is an accurate listing of all fields that can be filled in about the user.

### 0.3.4

#### External changes

- Support `--redact`, which replaces primary identifying information with "<redacted>".

#### Internal changes

- Simpler main file. Calls one function to get data, and one function to process data.
- Move test fixtures to conftest file.

### 0.3.3

#### External changes

- Increased exception handling, should catch some failed gh calls.
- Fewer external calls, should run faster by about 1-2 seconds.

#### Internal changes

- Makes one call to get recent PR activity instead of three.
- Check for authentication at first external gh call, rather than separate call just to check authentication.

### 0.3.2

#### External changes

- Fix `usename` -> `username` bug when user hasn't opened any recent issues.
- Show green flag when user hasn't opened recent issues.

#### Internal changes

- Simpler test for user with no recent issues; just test snippets of output.

### 0.3.1

#### External changes

- Fixes bug where overall issues flag was not taking into account repeated issue titles.

#### Internal changes

- Simpler logic for processing overall issues flag.

### 0.3.0

#### External changes

- Summarize recent public issue activity.
    - Look for multiple issues closed as `NOT_PLANNED`.
    - Look for multiple issues filed with identical titles, usually across multiple repositories.

#### Internal changes

- Strip ASCII color codes from gh output. We're only analyzing that text, so we didn't need it anyway. #28

### 0.2.5

#### External changes

- Simplify output: fewer blank lines, don't print individual lines for empty profile fields.

#### Internal changes

- Build summary string and then print that string, instead of using a series of print calls.
- Helper functions to build sections of summary.
- Initial unit tests for `_get_summary()`.
- Simpler logic for generating summary sections.

### 0.2.4

#### External changes

- Invalid usernames no longer cause a crash on older versions of the `gh` CLI.

### 0.2.3

#### External changes

- Supports `--version` flag.
- Added MIT license.

### 0.2.2

#### External changes

- Fix bug with yellow flag for account age. (#19)

### 0.2.1

#### External changes

- If status is 404 when getting initial profile information, exit with invalid GitHub username message.
- @hugovk was right, `created_at` is a better check than `status`. `status` not present for valid users. (#11)
- Ensure that gh CLI tool is authenticated before running. (#12)
- Use gh's default remote, rather than parsing output of `git remote -v` and taking first result. (#13)
- If a user has opened fewer than 10 PRs recently, don't analyze PR activity. Fixes zero division error bug from #14.
- Clarify gh CLI unauthenticated message to state that the API may have hung.

#### Internal changes

- Move CLI helper functions to utils module.

### 0.2.0

#### External changes

- Makes sure gh tool is installed.
- Show a `--help` message.
- Works from a GitHub username, PR number, or issue number.
- Clarify issue when PR activity call hangs.
- Simplified README.

#### Internal changes

- Use Click for CLI.

### 0.1.1

#### External changes

- Revise description.
- Require Python >= 3.10, not 3.14.
- Add usage instructions to README.
- Document release process.

#### Internal changes

- NA

### 0.1.0

Initial release. Shows a summary including username, account age, profile information, and recent PR activity. Uses green/ yellow/ red flags.
