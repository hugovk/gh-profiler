"""Examine a user's profile, and highlight evidence they're human or AI.

The goal is to help make quick, evidence-based decisions about how much time
to invest in reviewing PRs, and general interaction on open source projects.

Scores:
3: green
2: yellow
1: red

Package, so usage can be:
$ uvx gh-profiler ehmatthes

Or, maybe from within a project:
$ uvx gh-profiler <pr-num>

Given a PR number, it finds the author of the PR and runs the profiler on that 
user?
