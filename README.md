gh-profiler
===

Many of us have received waves of open source contributions where many of the new "contributions" aren't worth engaging with. gh-profiler lets you quickly see a snapshot of the submitter's profile, and recent PR activity.

This meant to give you some quick context about how much to invest in reviewing the PR. It's not meant to give an immediate signal to close the PR or issue.

Running as a tool
---

If you have uv installed, you can run this as a tool against any GitHub user:

```sh
$ uvx gh-profiler <redacted>
GitHub user: <redacted>
  🟡 Account age: 159 days

  🟢 Profile information:
      name: <redacted>
      blog: https://<redacted>.com
      email: info@<redacted>.com
     Empty fields: company, location, bio

  🟢 <redacted> has opened fewer than 10 PRs in the last 21 days.

  🔴 <redacted> has opened 6 new issues in the last 21 days.
     🟢 0 issues have been closed as NOT_PLANNED.
     🔴 6 issues were opened with the same title:
        📋 Documentation Enhancement Suggestion (6)
```

If you're working in your local project directory, you can simply provide a PR or issue number. The tool will look up the PR or issue, identify the user who opened it, and give a report on that user:

```sh
$ uvx gh-profiler 8
GitHub user: ehmatthes
  🟢 Account age: 5058 days
  ...
```

Installing and then running
---

You can also install the project, and then run the bare `gh-profiler` command:

```sh
(.venv) $ pip install gh-profiler
(.venv) $ gh-profiler ehmatthes
GitHub user: ehmatthes
  🟢 Account age: 5058 days
  ...
```

When you've installed the project, you can also run it as a module:

```sh
$ python -m gh_profiler <username>
```

Maintaining
---

### `--redact`

For live demos and screenshots, you can pass the `--redact` flag. The username and profile information sections will show "\<redacted\>" in place of identifying information:

```sh
$ uv run gh-profiler 39 --redact
GitHub user: <redacted>
  🟢 Account age: 5064 days

  🟢 Profile information:
      name: <redacted>
      blog: <redacted>
      ...
```

### Add/ modify a requirement

- Add or modify a requirement by modifying pyproject.toml, or running `uv add <package>`.
- For a dev dependency, run `uv add --dev <package>`.
- Then run `uv lock`.

Running tests
---

```sh
$ uv run pytest
```

New releases
---

Update changelog and bump version, then:

```sh
$ uv lock
# Commit all changes.
$ git tag vX.Y.Z
$ git push origin vX.Y.Z
$ rm -rf dist/*
$ uv build
$ uv publish
```
