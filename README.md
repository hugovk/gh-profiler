gh-profiler
===

Many of us have received waves of open source contributions where many of the new "contributions" aren't worth engaging with. gh-profiler lets you quickly see a snapshot of the submitter's profile, and recent PR activity.

This meant to give you some quick context about how much to invest in reviewing the PR. It's not meant to give an immediate signal to close the PR or issue.
